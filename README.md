# Recursive Pascal Triangle

This repo contains a simple recursive implementation of the Pascal Traingle algorithm with exponential complexity. The main objective is to test the execution time of various programming languages (python and scala). 

## Usage

A bash script determines the execution of the programs. 
Run this script to generate the resuts: `bash run.sh`

## Results

The file `results.ipynb` contains a basic statistical analysis of the results. Run the notebook for 
any updates.
